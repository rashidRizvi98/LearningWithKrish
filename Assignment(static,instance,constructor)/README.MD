# Static Block, Instance Block, Constructor

## Static Block:- 
	This is a block of code with static keyword.
	This can be used to initialize static variables of a class.
	This block will be executed even no instance was created from specific class;
	
	JVM executes static blocks before the main method at the time of loading a class.
	This was tested by Test1.java 

Output of Test1.java:-  <br/><br/>
![static main](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56111224/147820441-9523336e-8e88-4c64-980a-efc47a03bd32.png)

## instance Block:-
	This block is executed when an instance of a class is created and before constructor
	
## Constructor:-
	Constructor is executed when a instance of a class is created.
	

### Execute Test2.java to see the execution flow of static block,instance block and constructor.
